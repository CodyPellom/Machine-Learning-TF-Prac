**Tensorflow is Google's OS ML library and was started as OS in 2015. The library is actually written in C++**

*** C++ => Python; There are also Java binding for Tensorflow as well.  ***

Tensor: A structure that holds numbers; There are:
Vectors:[3,1,4]
Scalers: 3
Matrix: [3 4 
         1 5]

GPUs:

Since Images, and Pixels are based in Matrixes, over time GPUs were optimized to use Matrixes. Now, ML algorithms can use GPUs instead of CPUs. 

The way Javascript ML worked originally was the creators of deeplearn.js rewrote the C++ algorithms for Javascript using WebGL, which is essentially the web browser's Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). 

Kera: Keras was meant to be a higher level API where you could write your code, and it could operate over whatever programming language. Keras is now built on top of Tensorflow; The core API and the Layers API are the two parts of Tensorflow; 

Layers: Uses Keras

ML5: A wrappers on top of Canvas and DOM to make drawings, and pictures in Javascript using Tensorflow.
